      <p>
        Hi, I'm <b>Madhumithaa</b>, a passionate AI & Cloud enthusiast and 
        Electronics and Communication Engineering student.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems using 
        Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cloud technologies. 
        My interests include AI-driven applications, DevOps, and full-stack development.
      </p>
  
  
      <p>
        I enjoy transforming ideas into impactful projects — from cyberbullying detection 
        platforms to career readiness tools and deep learning applications. I am currently 
        focused on strengthening my skills in AI, Cloud, and Software Development 
        to build scalable and meaningful tech solutions.
